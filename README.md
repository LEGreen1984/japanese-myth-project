# japanese-myth-project
A second week html/css project about website design
This project is an initial template of a website. It focuses on the video game 'Okami' and is a hypothetical fansite.
It includes a jumbotron, functional Nav bar and is responsive to both desktop and ipad screens. It has a total of three pages and includes an embedded video on the 'trailer' page.

An example of this can be found at: ![an example of the website](okami-website-example.PNG)
No installation is required and the site can be reached from this URL: 

This site was built using CSS and HTML.
